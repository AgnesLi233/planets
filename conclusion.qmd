# Conclusion
Through this analysis, we explored various facets of exoplanet discoveries, including detection methods, orbital characteristics, and the contributions of key facilities. The findings demonstrate the dominance of certain detection methods like Transit and Radial Velocity, particularly after the launch of the Kepler mission, which significantly accelerated the pace of discoveries. Additionally, patterns in orbital periods, eccentricities, and planet radii provide insights into planetary systemsâ€™ diversity and structure.

However, there are notable limitations in this study, such as biases in detection methods favoring specific planet types and incomplete or missing data in some variables. Future work could incorporate advanced modeling techniques and predictive analysis to address these gaps and provide a more comprehensive understanding of planetary system formation and evolution. Key takeaways highlight the importance of missions like Kepler and the need for continued innovation in detection technology.

This study underscores the vast potential of data-driven exploration in advancing our knowledge of the cosmos and emphasizes the necessity of collaboration across scientific disciplines for future breakthroughs.
