    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn this project, we are performing an exploratory data analysis on the topic of how exoplanet detection methods have evolved over time. By analyzing data on exoplanet discoveries, we aim to uncover trends in detection techniques, examine the impact of technological advancements, and gain insights into the progression of this fascinating field.\nWe chose this topic because the study of exoplanets—planets that orbit stars outside our solar system—has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. Over the past few decades, advancements in technology and observational techniques have dramatically increased the rate at which exoplanets are discovered. This topic is particularly compelling because it highlights the rapid progress of modern astronomy while opening doors to fundamental questions about the origins of planetary systems, the uniqueness of Earth, and the potential for extraterrestrial life.\nFor those unfamiliar with exoplanets, an exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star beyond our solar system. While planets in our solar system have been known since ancient times, the first exoplanet was discovered as recently as 1992. Since then, thousands of exoplanets have been identified, spanning a wide range of sizes, compositions, and orbital configurations.\nDetecting exoplanets, however, is a significant challenge. These distant planets are often billions of miles away and much dimmer than the stars they orbit. To overcome these obstacles, astronomers have developed a variety of methods to infer the presence of exoplanets, both directly and indirectly. Each method has its own strengths, biases, and suitability for detecting different types of planets, which makes studying their evolution a fascinating exploration of scientific ingenuity.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, we will perform our analysis based on the NASA Exoplanet Archive, an online astronomical catalog and data service maintained by the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech (see link below). This archive collates and cross-correlates astronomical data on exoplanets and their host stars and updates on a weekly basis. All data in this archive are vetted by a team of astronomers and are linked back to the original literature reference. The data is accessible via online interactive tables and is also provided in downloadable tabular format such including csv. The dataset has 121 columns and 36557 rows, and includes exoplanet parameters (e.g., masses, radius, eccentricity), host information, and discovery/characterization data (e.g., discovery year, facility, method). Given the large number of available columns in the dataset, we will selectively download only those fields relevant to our analysis as a csv file and import using R and Python to avoid unnecessary complexity.\nThe following columns are selected for download and analysis (subjected to change):\nLink to NASA Expoplanet Archieve: https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS",

These missing values may impact some part of the analysis, particularly in examining planetary characteristics and dynamics. However, it will be impact our analysis on the evolution of detection methods.",
