    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe study of exoplanets—planets that orbit stars outside our solar system—has dramatically reshaped our understanding of the universe. This topic was chosen because it represents a compelling intersection of astronomy, technology, and the search for extraterrestrial life. Over the last few decades, advancements in detection techniques have revolutionized the rate and scope of exoplanet discoveries, raising profound questions about the diversity of planetary systems, the potential habitability of other worlds, and the origins of our own solar system.\nThis project focuses on analyzing how exoplanet detection methods have evolved over time. Specifically, we aim to explore:\n\nHow have different detection methods been utilized over time?\nWhat trends emerge in exoplanet discoveries based on technological advancements?\nHow does the choice of detection method influence the types of planets discovered?\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the topic, detecting exoplanets is a significant scientific and technological challenge. Unlike planets in our solar system, exoplanets are incredibly distant and often hidden in the glare of their host stars. The first exoplanet was discovered in 1992, and since then, thousands have been identified using methods such as the transit technique, radial velocity, direct imaging, and gravitational microlensing. Each method has its strengths and biases, shaping the kinds of exoplanets we are able to detect.\nBy investigating these questions, we hope to provide insights into the progression of exoplanet science and highlight how technological innovation has expanded our view of the cosmos.",

Ground-based observatories, like SuperWASP, W. M. Keck Observatory, and La Silla, also contribute substantially, albeit at smaller scales. The chart underscores the critical impact of advanced space telescopes in exoplanet exploration.\n6. How do orbital eccentricities of exoplanets differ across various detection methods?\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = pl_orbeccen, fill = discoverymethod)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +\n  facet_wrap(~discoverymethod, scales = \"free_y\") + # Separate panels for each method\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Eccentricity by Detection Method\",\n       x = \"Eccentricity\", y = \"Density\",\n       fill = \"Detection Method\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8)) + # Remove redundant legend for facets\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: This series of density plots explores the orbital eccentricities of exoplanets identified by different detection methods. Key observations include:\n\nRadial Velocity and Imaging methods detect planets with a broader range of eccentricities, highlighting their versatility in capturing varied orbital configurations.\nTransit and Transit Timing Variations overwhelmingly detect planets with low eccentricities, likely due to their alignment requirements with the observer.\nMethods like Pulsar Timing and Orbital Brightness Modulation reveal sharply peaked distributions, suggesting sensitivity to specific orbital characteristics.\n\nThe differences in eccentricity profiles reflect the unique selection biases and sensitivities of each detection method.\n7. What is the distribution of distances between exoplanets and their host stars, and how are these distances distributed on a logarithmic scale?\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = sy_dist)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7, boundary = 0) +\n  geom_density(aes(y = ..count..), color = \"darkred\", size = 1) + # Overlay density curve\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(10, 100, 1000), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey50\") + # Annotations\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 10, y = 5000, label = \"Nearby Stars\", hjust = -0.2, color = \"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1000, y = 5000, label = \"Far Systems\", hjust = 1.5, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Planet Distances from Host Star\",\n       subtitle = \"Using logarithmic scale for distances in parsecs\",\n       x = \"Distance (Parsecs, Log Scale)\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, face = \"italic\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: This plot illustrates the distribution of exoplanet distances from their host stars, measured in parsecs on a logarithmic scale. Most exoplanets are detected between 100 and 1000 parsecs, reflecting the observational range of telescopes like Kepler and TESS. Nearby stars (&lt;10 parsecs) show fewer detections, likely due to observational constraints, while distant systems beyond 1000 parsecs account for a small fraction of discoveries. The distribution highlights the focus on mid-range distances, where detection techniques are most effective.\n8. What patterns exist in the relationship between orbital eccentricity and period across different exoplanet detection methods?\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = pl_orbper, y = pl_orbeccen, color = discoverymethod)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1.5) + # Smaller points with transparency\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, size = 1, linetype = \"dashed\") + \n  scale_x_log10() +\n  facet_wrap(~ discoverymethod, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 3) + # Facet by discovery method\n  labs(title = \"Eccentricity vs Orbital Period by Discovery Method\",\n       subtitle = \"Faceted to highlight patterns across discovery methods\",\n       x = \"Orbital Period (days, Log Scale)\", y = \"Eccentricity\",\n       color = \"Discovery Method\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 11) +\n  force_panelsizes(total_height = unit(9, \"cm\")) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, face = \"italic\"),\n        legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: This plot examines the relationship between eccentricity and orbital period, faceted by different discovery methods. Each facet highlights the unique distribution of these variables for a particular detection technique. For example, radial velocity (purple) covers a wide range of orbital periods with varying eccentricities, while transit (pink) focuses on shorter orbital periods and lower eccentricities. The logarithmic scale for orbital period emphasizes the clustering and spread of planets across detection methods, showcasing the diversity in planetary systems and the strengths of each method in uncovering specific types of planets.\n9. What are the average planet radii detected by different methods, and how much variability exists within these detections?\n\n\nCode\navg_radius &lt;- cleaned_data |&gt;\n  group_by(discoverymethod) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_radius = mean(pl_rade, na.rm = TRUE),\n    sd_radius = sd(pl_rade, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nggplot(avg_radius, aes(x = reorder(discoverymethod, -avg_radius), y = avg_radius, fill = discoverymethod)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = avg_radius - sd_radius, ymax = avg_radius + sd_radius),\n                width = 0.2) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Average Planet Radius by Detection Method with Variability\",\n       subtitle = \"Error bars represent one standard deviation\",\n       x = \"Detection Method\",\n       y = \"Average Radius (Earth Radii)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, face = \"italic\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: This plot shows the average radius of planets detected by various methods, with error bars representing one standard deviation. Detection methods such as Imaging and Radial Velocity show larger average radii, reflecting their ability to detect larger planets. Transit methods, with their wider range and significant variability, detect planets across different sizes, including smaller Earth-like ones. This visualization highlights how different detection techniques are specialized for identifying specific types of planets, with variability in planet radii reflecting the strengths and constraints of each method.\n10. How do the yearly contributions of key astronomical facilities to exoplanet discoveries compare, and what trends are observed over time?\n\n\nCode\nfacility_trend &lt;- cleaned_data |&gt;\n  group_by(disc_year, disc_facility) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt;\n  filter(disc_facility %in% c(\"Kepler\", \"TESS\", \"K2\", \"SuperWASP\"))  # Include TESS\n\nggplot(facility_trend, aes(x = disc_year, y = count, color = disc_facility)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Yearly Discoveries by Key Facilities\",\n       subtitle = \"Kepler dominates discoveries in the 2010s\",\n       x = \"Discovery Year\", y = \"Number of Discoveries\",\n       color = \"Facility\") +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n           x = 2014,\n           y = 10500,\n           label = \"Kepler peaks\",\n           color = \"green\",\n           angle = 40,\n           size = 4) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, face = \"italic\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: This plot highlights the annual contributions of key facilities to exoplanet discoveries, with a particular emphasis on the dominance of the Kepler mission in the 2010s. The peak around 2015 underscores Kepler’s significant impact on exoplanet research, showcasing its ability to detect thousands of planets during its operation.
