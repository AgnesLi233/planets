    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn this project, we are performing an exploratory data analysis on the topic of how exoplanet detection methods have evolved over time. By analyzing data on exoplanet discoveries, we aim to uncover trends in detection techniques, examine the impact of technological advancements, and gain insights into the progression of this fascinating field.\nWe chose this topic because the study of exoplanets—planets that orbit stars outside our solar system—has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. Over the past few decades, advancements in technology and observational techniques have dramatically increased the rate at which exoplanets are discovered. This topic is particularly compelling because it highlights the rapid progress of modern astronomy while opening doors to fundamental questions about the origins of planetary systems, the uniqueness of Earth, and the potential for extraterrestrial life.\nFor those unfamiliar with exoplanets, an exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star beyond our solar system. While planets in our solar system have been known since ancient times, the first exoplanet was discovered as recently as 1992. Since then, thousands of exoplanets have been identified, spanning a wide range of sizes, compositions, and orbital configurations.\nDetecting exoplanets, however, is a significant challenge. These distant planets are often billions of miles away and much dimmer than the stars they orbit. To overcome these obstacles, astronomers have developed a variety of methods to infer the presence of exoplanets, both directly and indirectly. Each method has its own strengths, biases, and suitability for detecting different types of planets, which makes studying their evolution a fascinating exploration of scientific ingenuity.",
