# Introduction

The study of exoplanets—planets that orbit stars outside our solar system—has dramatically reshaped our understanding of the universe. This topic was chosen because it represents a compelling intersection of astronomy, technology, and the search for extraterrestrial life. Over the last few decades, advancements in detection techniques have revolutionized the rate and scope of exoplanet discoveries, raising profound questions about the diversity of planetary systems, the potential habitability of other worlds, and the origins of our own solar system.

This project focuses on analyzing how exoplanet detection methods have evolved over time. Specifically, we aim to explore:
	1.	How have different detection methods been utilized over time?
	2.	What trends emerge in exoplanet discoveries based on technological advancements?
	3.	How does the choice of detection method influence the types of planets discovered?

For those unfamiliar with the topic, detecting exoplanets is a significant scientific and technological challenge. Unlike planets in our solar system, exoplanets are incredibly distant and often hidden in the glare of their host stars. The first exoplanet was discovered in 1992, and since then, thousands have been identified using methods such as the transit technique, radial velocity, direct imaging, and gravitational microlensing. Each method has its strengths and biases, shaping the kinds of exoplanets we are able to detect.

By investigating these questions, we hope to provide insights into the progression of exoplanet science and highlight how technological innovation has expanded our view of the cosmos.
